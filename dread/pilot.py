"""dread pilot: the reconstruction loop run by code, a language model only for the judgement.

The tools decide everything a program can decide: which function is next, what the model is told,
whether its answer is right. The model does the part only judgement can do: write readable C from a
listing. For each function:

1. The question: the rules (behaviour exactly as the machine code's, faults included; dread.h; no
   variables of its own; no library calls), the function's flat listing (dread flat), its callers'
   constant arguments, the prototypes of what it calls (argument counts from dread.regflow), what
   its callers read after it, and the lifted C (dread lift), which is exact but unreadable.
2. The answer's ```c block goes into src/pilot/NAME.c, with auto("NAME") in tests/cases/pilot.py.
3. The checks, in order: dread recon (it builds), dread test (every case agrees and the cases run
   every instruction), dread integration --callers (no difference through the real callers), dread
   mutate --kill (no change to the C goes unnoticed). What fails goes back to the model with the
   tools' own words, up to --tries answers. A change no case and no search notices may be one that
   cannot alter behaviour: the model then argues each such survivor in a sentence (or corrects the
   C), and the arguments go into argued.tsv marked as the pilot's and not reviewed.
4. Accepted: the file stays, marked as written by the pilot and read by nobody; rejected: it is
   removed. Either way the conversation is kept in BUILD/pilot/IMAGE/NAME.md and the outcome in
   BUILD/pilot/IMAGE/results.tsv.

Without names, the candidates are the functions of the image's lifted table that src does not define
(their cases are known to cover them), smallest first. Providers: dread.llm (~/.config/dread/llm.toml).

Model-written C is its own kind: checked by cases, mutation and integration, but nobody has read it.
Count it apart from C people wrote, and read it before calling it understood.

SYSTEM = """You rewrite one function of a firmware image in C. Your C is compiled with
    {compiler}
and linked over the original image in the function's place. Then the original machine code and
your C run side by side in an emulator on many inputs and must do exactly the same: the return
value, every memory write outside the stack, every peripheral access in the same order, and the
registers the callers rely on.

Rules:
- The function's name is exactly {name}. Its behaviour equals the machine code's exactly, including
  what looks like a bug: fix nothing, add no check the code does not make, leave nothing out.
- #include "dread.h": it defines u8, s8, u16, s16, u32, s32, u64, s64; VAR(type, address) for memory
  of the original at an address; VVAR(type, address) for memory that must be read or written every
  time; REG8, REG16, REG32(address) for peripheral registers (every access kept, in order).
- Declare each function you call with the prototype given; do not write their bodies.
- No global or static variables (the original's start-up would not set them up); constants are fine.
- No library calls (no memcpy, no division helpers): loops, and the image's own functions.
- Answer with one ```c block holding the whole file. A short note outside the block is allowed."""
