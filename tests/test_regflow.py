"""dread regflow on gizmo: what callers read after a call, what functions read at their entry, and
that the runner and the integration run compare the registers it finds.

Both gizmo builds have one register a compiler kept across a call: uart_puts keeps its string
pointer in r1 across bl uart_putc (GCC -fipa-ra, the two are in one file). On a32 the remainder of
__aeabi_uidivmod comes back in r1 too. Anything else found would be a false alarm."""
