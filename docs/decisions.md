# Decisions taken by recommendation

The user, 2026-10-20: "Generally I leave decision to your recommendation. Just note it down so I
can review your decisions later." A question that used to wait in `docs/todo.md` ("Questions for
the user") is decided by the recommended option and written down here: the question, the options,
the choice, why, and how to undo it. What only the user can do (provide files, credentials, buy or
install system software) and what cannot be undone (a force-push, making something public) still
goes to the user.

Newest first. "Status" says whether the choice is in the code yet.

## Refusing a case whose input makes code touch saved registers (2026-10-20)

**Decided by recommendation.**

- **Question.** A generated input can make a callee copy past a local of its caller (a queue whose
  item size the input made larger than the item, a global pointer aimed into the stack): memcpy
  then writes over a saved register (xFirstTimerHandler's r4, which its pop restores) or reads saved
  registers into memory (prvNotifyQueueSetContainer copies its own saved r7 into a queue). C lays
  out its frames otherwise, so the images differ: most of the disagreements left on the FreeRTOS
  builds were of this kind (r4 or r7 "after the return", a byte "68 vs 0").
- **Options.** (a) Keep failing such cases (a function with one is dropped). (b) Refuse a case whose
  images differ when, run again on the original, anything but a push, a pop, or a save or restore
  of that register touches a saved register's slot of a frame still on the stack; name what touched
  which register; check the stale stack data first (a case whose every difference that explains
  is compared except those outputs and keeps its coverage).
- **Choice: (b).** The case's outcome is the original's frame layout, which C cannot be held to,
  as with a stack address taken for a value (refused since before). A case without a difference is
  never refused, and one whose differences the saved registers do not explain still fails.
- **Undo.** Revert the runner commit "a case whose input makes code touch saved registers is
  refused" (such cases fail again).
- **Status.** Done (runner, saves_touched, 2026-10-20). Against measurement 26 on seven builds: +8
  (xFirstTimerHandler, TIMER0_Handler, xQueueSelectFromSetFromISR, prvNotifyQueueSetContainer on three
  builds, prvUnlockQueue, vQueueOverwritePeriodicISRDemo), none lost.

## A variadic callee's argument registers the caller did not set (2026-10-20)

**Decided by the user**, following the recommendation.

- **Question.** A variadic function stores every argument register from its first unnamed one on
  into its save area (FreeRTOS's demo sprintf: r2 and r3, the area's address handed to
  tiny_print), so regflow counts them read. A caller that passes fewer (`sprintf(buf, "%d", n)` sets
  r0 to r2) then seems to read what the previous callee left in r3: 12 functions of the clang builds
  are refused for reading r3 behind memset.
- **Options.** (a) Keep refusing. (b) At a call site, a register the variadic callee only stores into
  its save area counts as read only where the caller set it before the call: those callers lift, and
  a loop case's stub of the variadic callee logs the registers the caller set, not one it left.
- **Choice: (b).** The registers left out hold a leftover the original passes by accident; the
  format reads it only if the original reads an argument it did not pass, which is undefined in C.
  It takes from what a stub logs at such call sites, nothing else.
- **What came of it.** Tracing it to implement (b) showed the refusals were a regflow bug, not a
  question: clang's sprintf opens with sub sp, #8 before it stores r2 and r3, and the move took sp
  out of the bases of the frame stores regflow looks for, so the save area went unseen (GCC's, a
  push, was seen). Fixed in regflow 14: clang's save areas are no read either, as GCC's have been
  since regflow 4, at every call site, and the 18 refusals are gone (clang -Os 6, clang -O2 6, the
  M4F clang build 6 of 13). Nothing more is left out of a comparison than regflow 4 already left out.
  The per-site part of (b), counting a save-area register where the caller set it and logging it at
  a stubbed call, is not built: it would compare more than now, and a stub cannot tell a lifted
  caller's call sites (the C's) from one another.
- **Undo.** Revert regflow 14 (the refusals come back with it).
- **Status.** Done as the bug fix (regflow 14, 2026-10-20).

## Comparing a stale-data case except its stale bytes (2026-10-20)

**Decided by recommendation** (the user's standing delegation of the same day).

- **Question.** A case whose every difference is bytes the original wrote from stale stack data (an
  uninitialised local: FreeRTOS's timer commands carry a union member nobody set into the timer
  queue) is refused, as a case whose original took a stack address for a value is (rule 6, nothing
  compared is taken away). Where every case carries such bytes, the function is left uncovered
  (vStartTimerDemoTask, and xTaskIncrementTick by its recorded case: about two functions on each
  MPS2 build).
- **Options.** (a) Keep refusing. (b) Compare such a case except the bytes the fills moved in the
  original (the bytes whose value the original itself does not define), every other output as
  before, the bytes left out named in the report.
- **Choice: (b).** The bytes left out are exactly those the original does not define (they change
  with what the stack held before the call); every byte the original defines is still compared, and
  the report names what was left out, so a reader sees it.
- **Undo.** Revert the runner commit "a case whose every difference is the original's stale stack
  data is compared except those outputs" (such cases are refused again).
- **Status.** Done (runner, 2026-10-20): the report line reads "compared except what the original's
  stale stack data (an uninitialised local) decides: ...".
